# Prompt Engineering using LangChain ðŸ¦œ

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering using LangChain** course! This is an **ongoing** hands-on tutorial series where we delve deep into mastering prompt engineering with **LangChain**, a powerful framework designed for building applications using large language models (LLMs).

## Course Overview
This course is designed to guide you through various aspects of **prompt engineering**, focusing on **LangChain**'s features and how they integrate with machine learning models. Each chapter will provide detailed hands-on learning through **Jupyter Notebooks**, and these are linked to the video tutorials in the course playlist.

## Chapters Overview

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 1: Foundations of Prompt Engineering](./)
This chapter covers the **basics** of prompt engineering, including machine learning concepts, tokenizers, and LangChainâ€™s role in NLP. It's great for beginners who want to understand how prompts work and how LangChain fits into the larger picture of LLMs.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 2: LangChain Integrations with External Models](./ch2_langchain_model_integrations.ipynb)
Learn how to integrate LangChain with popular models such as **OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT** and **HuggingFace models**, and manage token usage with **dotenv** for secure key management. This chapter shows you how to link LangChain to external sources and systems effectively.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 3: Mastering Prompt Templates](./ch3_prompt_templates.ipynb)
Dive into **dynamic and reusable prompts** with LangChain's `PromptTemplate`. You will learn how to build customizable prompts that fit multiple use cases and make your prompts more adaptable and efficient.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 4: Effective Prompt Generation Techniques](./ch4_effective_prompt_generation.ipynb)
In this chapter, we explore strategies for designing smart prompts that can help guide chatbots or language models to behave in the way you want. This is all about improving interactions between the model and the user.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 5: Few-shot Learning with LangChain](./ch5_fewshot_learning.ipynb)
Learn how to apply **few-shot learning** with LangChain for tasks like **Q&A**, solving **riddles**, or even applying the technique to **domain-specific applications**. Youâ€™ll learn to train models with just a few examples.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 6: Output Parsing and Custom Responses](./ch6_output_parsing.ipynb)
Explore techniques for extracting **structured outputs** from language models using LangChainâ€™s built-in parsers and **Pydantic**-compatible formats. Perfect for those looking to handle the model's responses in a structured and reliable manner.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 7: Memory in LangChain](./ch07_langchain_memory_prompt_engineering.ipynb)
Memory plays a big role in prompt engineering. In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn about different memory types in LangChain, such as:
  - **Conversation Buffer** and **Window Buffer**
  - **Summary Memory** and **Entities Memory**
  - **Memory Saving and Loading** mechanisms
This chapter covers **how memory can be used** to maintain state and ensure that the context is preserved across different interactions.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 8: QnA/RAG Techniques](./)
Here, we dive into **QnA (Question-Answering)** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** techniques. These methods combine the power of information retrieval and generation for improving answer quality. You'll learn about:
  - Extractive vs **Generative QnA**
  - **Closed** & **Open QnA** systems
  - Working with **NLP Vectors**, and more.

### ðŸ”¹ [Chapter 9: RAG Techniques with LangChain](./ch9_rag_documents_embedding_indexing_and_qna.ipynb)
In this chapter, we focus on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques using LangChain. Youâ€™ll learn about:
  - **Document Chunking** and **Embedding** processes
  - How to **Index** documents and set up **QnA Chains** to improve model retrieval and response generation.
